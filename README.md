  <b>Learner's Purpose:</b> Infinite Yield Remake
  <h1>Prism.</h1>
</div>

A project based off **[Infinite Yield](https://github.com/EdgeIY/infiniteyield)**, designed entirely for studying and learning deeper into Lua.

Currently, Prism is in BETA v1.0.0, with `7` commands.

**Prism** is not intended to be used as a main command-line source, instead check out **[Infinite Yield](https://github.com/EdgeIY/infiniteyield)**.

> Use Prism for Yourself:
```lua
loadstring(game:HttpGet(
  "https://github.com/mr-suno/Prism-Admin/blob/main/main.lua?raw=true"
))()
```

---

- **Main Differences from IY and Prism**:
- - Prism is rewritten entirely from scratch, containing no code from **Infinite Yield**.
- - Slight UI changes & differences. _(Although the main concept is the same)_

P.S. _This project is likely to not be maintained, and bug fixes may not come._

Prism developed by Suno **<|:)**
